# Release & Public Availability Plan

## Recommended launch path (fastest)
1. **GitHub Releases** (binary zip from CI)
2. **Landing page** (GitHub Pages / Cloudflare Pages)
3. **Payment link** (Lemon Squeezy, Gumroad, Paddle, or Stripe Payment Link)
4. **License delivery** (manual key in v1, automate in v2)

## Why not Microsoft Store first?
- Store onboarding and policy review add friction/time.
- For MVP and quick validation, direct distribution is faster.
- Add MS Store after product-market fit.

## v1 commercialization
- Basic: $9.99 one-time
- Pro: $19.99 one-time (auto-detect + app rules + extra language packs)

## Milestones
- M1: Stable conversion + tests
- M2: Signed binary + release artifact
- M3: Landing page + checkout + download flow
- M4: Early user feedback loop + bugfix cadence

## Optional public channels
- Product Hunt
- Reddit language-learning / typing communities
- Hebrew/Russian tech communities
- YouTube short demos
